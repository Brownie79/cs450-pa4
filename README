1) Add the O_EXTENT Flag 
- Stat.h: keeps track of the metadata of the files
    - added T_EXTENT 4 for a new type of file to be recognized by the system
- fcntl.h: 16 bit flag for operations
    - added O_EXTENT as flag 0x010
- Sysfile.c: keeps track of the system files
    - open(): added a check to see if new file of extent needs to created vs a regular file
    - create(): allows you to open files of type T_EXTENT

2) Change fstat() to dump extent info:
    - added print statements in fstat() @ sysfile.c to print extent file type info when it's called
